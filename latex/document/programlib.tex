\chapter{Command-line access and exit values}
\label{programlibchapter}

The procedures described in this section are exported by the
\defrsixlibrary{programs} library.

\begin{entry}{%
\proto{command-line}{}{procedure}}

Returns a nonempty list of strings.
The first element is an implementation-specific
name for the running top-level program.  The remaining elements are command-line
arguments according to the operating system's conventions.
\end{entry}

\begin{entry}{%
\proto{exit}{}{procedure}
\rproto{exit}{ obj}{procedure}}

Exits the running program and communicates an exit value to the 
operating system.  If no argument is supplied, the {\cf exit}
procedure should communicate to the operating system that the program 
exited normally.  If an argument is supplied, the {\cf exit} procedure 
should translate the argument into an appropriate exit value for the 
operating system.  If \var{obj} is \schfalse{}, the exit is assumed to
be abnormal.
\end{entry}
