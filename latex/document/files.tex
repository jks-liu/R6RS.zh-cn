\chapter{File system}
\label{filesystemchapter}

This chapter describes the \defrsixlibrary{files} library for
operations on the file system.  This library, in addition to the
procedures described here, also exports the I/O condition types
described in section~\ref{iocondsection}.

\begin{entry}{%
\proto{file-exists?}{ filename}{procedure}}

\domain{\var{Filename} must be a file name (see
  section~\ref{filenamesection}).}  The {\cf file-exists?} procedure
returns \schtrue{} if the named file exists at the time the procedure
is called, \schfalse{} otherwise.
\end{entry}

\begin{entry}{%
\proto{delete-file}{ filename}{procedure}}

\domain{\var{Filename} must be a file name (see
  section~\ref{filenamesection}).}  The {\cf delete-file} procedure
deletes the named file if it exists and can be deleted, and returns
\unspecifiedreturn.  If the file does not exist or cannot be deleted,
an exception with condition type {\cf\&i/o-filename} is raised.
\end{entry}
